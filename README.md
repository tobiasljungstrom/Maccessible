# Maccessible
A component library in the style of classic Mac OS, focused on full accesibility.

This project is still in its infancy, and if you want to contribute and be a part of it you are more than welcome!

Working on this project you can expect to learn about:

- Building, testing and prototyping web components
- Web accessibility
- New and cool tools, like pnpm (or whichever we choose)
